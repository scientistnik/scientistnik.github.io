Observing the behavior of people, I often notice problems arising from their banal misunderstanding of certain things. On the one hand, I want to help these people by explaining the error, but often this leads to the opposite effect. While in my head I have not formulated an algorithm by which it is possible to explain the main problem in a couple of minutes without rejection on his part. <!--truncate-->However, for myself I have identified several levels of misunderstanding problems leading to frequent errors that I would like to discuss:

## Misunderstanding of uncertainty or philosophical level.

Very often I come across people's misunderstanding of the uncertainty of this World. Its uncertainty is a consequence of unpredictable things - on the one hand, and philosophical reasoning - on the other. But despite this, many persistently try to find an explanation for certain events, categorically not believing that it happened without someone's idea.

Earlier [talking about philosophy] (philosophy-begin), I mentioned a little the uncertainty of our World. But I would like to expand on this topic in more detail in order to demonstrate its validity to a greater extent. I will definitely do this by one of the following posts!

## Misunderstanding of another person or social level.

People often don't understand each other. Because of this, disagreements, conflicts and even wars begin. The root of these evils, it seems to me, is not so much in the [incorrect assessment of another person's motivation] (world-model) (although this is also the case), as in the absence of attempts at this very assessment: it is easier for many to label a person (stupid, drug addict, prostitute, etc.) than to actually understand his motives. 

This topic is also quite extensive, it cannot be disclosed in one post.

## Misunderstanding of oneself or personal level.

People often don't even understand themselves. Since the time of Sigmund Freud, humanity has known about the existence of the unconscious and that many of our actions we first commit, and only then logically justify. According to various estimates, up to 80% of our actions occur unconsciously. Moreover, we often notice the illogical behavior of others, but we do not find this in our behavior. Don't you think it's strange?!

In any case, this is another topic that I want to talk about separately.


## Having described these problems, I hope that 

- firstly, I will be able to clearly organize the main points, 

- secondly, I will have links to long posts that deal with this or that problem. This can be forwarded to someone to read. And perhaps this will be the answer to the question posed at the beginning of the article?!
